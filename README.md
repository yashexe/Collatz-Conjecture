# Collatz-Conjecture

This is a GUI application that allows the user to input a positive integer and generates the Collatz sequence for that number. The Collatz sequence is a mathematical conjecture that states that if you take any positive integer and perform the following operations:

1. if the integer is even, divide it by 2
2. If the integer is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 
3. Repeat this process. You will eventually reach the number 1. 


The sequence of integers generated by this process is called the Collatz sequence. The program also plots the Collatz sequence on various graphs for visualization.

The examples in this repository are the collatz conjecture sequence of a starting number 10.

## Usage

To use this code, run it in a Python interpreter and enter a positive integer when prompted.

## Code Breakdown

**if \__name\__ == \"\__main\__"\:** used to specify that the CollatzGUI class should only be executed if the script is run directly from the command line and not imported as a module.

**\__init__\(self,root):** Initializes the Collatz GUI with the specified root window.

**onButtonClick(self,event=None):** Event handler for the "Generate Sequence" button. Gets the input number from the text box and generates the Collatz sequence for it.

**plotAll(self,num):** Plots the Collatz sequence for the given number on various graphs.

**collatz(self,num):** Generates the Collatz sequence for the given number and returns it as a list.

**plotSingularX(self,Data):** Plots the Collatz sequence on the x-axis.

**plotSingularY(self,Data):** Plots the Collatz sequence on the y-axis.

**plotSingularBar(self,Data):** Plots the Collatz sequence as a bar graph.

**plotSequenceLength(self,num):** Plots the length of the Collatz sequence for the given number.

**plotMultipleY(self,num):** Plots the Collatz sequence for the given number and all integers up to it on the y-axis.
