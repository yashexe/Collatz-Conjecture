# Collatz-Conjecture

This is a GUI application that allows the user to input a positive integer and generates the Collatz sequence for that number. The Collatz sequence is a mathematical conjecture that states that if you take any positive integer and perform the following operations:

1. if the integer is even, divide it by 2
2. If the integer is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 
3. Repeat this process. You will eventually reach the number 1. 


The sequence of integers generated by this process is called the Collatz sequence. The program also plots the Collatz sequence on various graphs for visualization. The examples in this repository are the collatz conjecture sequence of a starting number 10.
